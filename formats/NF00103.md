| Description and Justification | Adobe InDesign is a professional desktop publishing program, developed by Adobe. It is used to create graphically rich documents, magazines, books, brochures, newspapers and other more sophisticated texts. The INDD files are documents with various page layout formatting and graphics elements and linked images, created with and used by the application. Adobe InDesign is a proprietary format, but it can be converted to PDF for record content sustainability. |
