| Description and Justification | In the Apple macOS operating system, .DS_Store (Desktop Services Store) is a binary file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image. It is created and maintained by the Finder application in every folder. Starting with a period character it is hidden in Finder. Its internal structure is proprietary, but has since been reverse-engineered. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. |
