| Description and Justification | An archive file is a container file that is used to collect multiple data files together into a single file for easier portability and storage, or simply to compress files to use less storage space. Beyond archival purposes, archive files are frequently used for packaging software for distribution, as software contents are often naturally spread across several files; the archive is then known as a package. While the archival file format is the same, there are additional conventions about contents, such as requiring a manifest file. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. |
