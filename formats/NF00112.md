| Notes | Pre-release of Heritrix 1.0, an amendment was made to the ARC file version 1 format to allow writing of extra metadata into first record of an ARC file. This extra metadata is written as XML. If the extra XML metadata info is present, the second '<reserved>' field of the second line of version 1 ARC files will be changed from '0' to '1': i.e. ARCs with XML metadata are version '1.1'. |

| Description and Justification | An ARC is a container format created when harvesting and creating web archives. It is a container wrapped around plain text files metadata (DAT) and indexing (CDX) files, as well as the component files that comprise the archived web sites. The container wrapper and its DAT and CDX files are machine and human readable, and it is a stable and well-documented open format. Web archives in general should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. ARC  is considered an acceptable format as per NARA Transfer Guidance. |
