| NARA Risk Level | Moderate Risk | 
| NARA Preservation Action | Transform | 
| NARA Proposed Preservation Plan | Transform to Adobe Geospatial PDF and retain DWG | 
| Description and Justification | The file format is proprietary with limited open or available documentation. Currently, NARA transforms DWG to Adobe Geospatial PDF using FME, and also retains the original DWG files. In some cases, it may be necessary to generate multiple PDFs for one DWG file, when the image is too large to fit on one PDF page while retaining visual details of the original file. FME allows the user to select pieces of the image to transform into PDF. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | FME Desktop; Global Mapper |
