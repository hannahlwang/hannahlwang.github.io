| NARA Risk Level | Moderate Risk | 
| NARA Preservation Action | Transform | 
| NARA Proposed Preservation Plan | Transform to a TBD format, possibly PDF or KML | 
| Description and Justification | RTE (template) files and RVT (project) files are actual Revit projects. The difference between the two is that the template is used to start a new project. The file format is proprietary with limited open or available documentation. Revit is still sold and supported in the marketplace, so transformation may be possible.  | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | FME Desktop |
