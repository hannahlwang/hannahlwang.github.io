| Description and Justification | A batch file is a script file in DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows. It is a plain text file which consists of a series of commands to be executed by the command-line interpreter. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
