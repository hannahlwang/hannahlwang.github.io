| Description and Justification | A binary file is a computer file that is not a text file, typically containing bytes that are intended to be interpreted as something other than text characters. Compiled computer programs are typical examples; compiled applications are sometimes referred to as binaries. But binary files can also mean that they contain images, sounds, compressed versions of other files, etc. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. |
