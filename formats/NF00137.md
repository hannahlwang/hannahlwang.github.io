| Description and Justification | A BTR file is a proprietary database file created by the Btrieve, transactional database program BTR files generally have an associated set of DDF data definition files that describe the database structure. Btrieve 12 is still supported, but no new products/enhancement have been released since 2015. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Procure and/or develop tools. Any process will require Actian (formerly Pervasive) Btrieve drivers. Access can read btrieve tables only if there are data definitions available, which are Btrieve .DDF files. If there are no ddf's, the processing archivist will need to create them from scratch with either a 3rd party tool such as BtSearch or use Actian's products. With both the BTR and DDF files and the Actian/Pervasive ODBC driver to set up ODBC DSNs the data can be read with MS Access. |
