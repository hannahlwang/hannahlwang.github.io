| Description and Justification | C# is a language derived from C, one of several C derivatives to add object-oriented features. C# was introduced by Microsoft in conjunction with the .NET application framework, but has since been approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. CS files are plain text. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
