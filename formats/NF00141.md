| Description and Justification | Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS files are plain text. Web archives should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
