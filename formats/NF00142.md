| Description and Justification | ColdFusion is a commercial rapid web-application development computing platform and its closely associated scripting language, ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML). CFML compares to the scripting components of ASP, JSP, and PHP in purpose and features, but its tag syntax more closely resembles HTML, while its script syntax resembles JavaScript. CFML files are plain text. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
