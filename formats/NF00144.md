| Description and Justification | Common Data Format is a conceptual data abstraction for storing, manipulating, and accessing multidimensional data sets developed by NASA. The CDF software library and toolkit, documentation, and user support services are provided by NASA. CDF files are binary. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | For CDF to ASCII transformations, use the cdfexport tool included in the CDF distribution package. |
