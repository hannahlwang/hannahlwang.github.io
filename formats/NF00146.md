| Description and Justification | Configuration files (commonly known as config files) are plain text files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs. They are used for user applications, server processes and operating system settings. A number of general-purpose serialization formats exist that can represent complex data structures in an easily stored format, and these are often used as a basis for configuration files, such as XML, TOML, YAML and JSON. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | These are such ubiquitous extensions that there is no way to narrow down the format without additional characterization. Case-by-case review is required. |
