| Description and Justification | RPT files are created with SAP Crystal Reports software. The format is proprietary with limited open or available documentation. Unicode was introduced in version 9, and the current software is not compatible with files created in earlier versions. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | SAP Crystal Reports Viewer (for version 9+); Further research is required for earlier versions. |
