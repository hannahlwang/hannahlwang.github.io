| Description and Justification | DAT is not a single, specific file type, but is a generic extension for "data" files for a variety of applications. This can be just about anything: unstructured or structured plain text, raster or vector graphic, or other binary data. There is no generalizable specification or structure for a .DAT file. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. Attempt to associate with a software package. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | This is such a ubiquitous extension that there is no way to narrow down the format without additional characterization. Case-by-case review is required. |
