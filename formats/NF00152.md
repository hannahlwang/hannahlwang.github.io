| NARA Preservation Action | Transform | 
| NARA Proposed Preservation Plan | Transform to CSV if possible, otherwise retain | 
| Description and Justification | The DB file extension is used by over a dozen database applications. Because there are so many potential applications that create this format, it is difficult to identify the specific application and ensure that a migration will retain the data with high fidelity. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | This format can be created and used by various applications, therefore the software required to open and convert it is often unknown at the time of transfer. Further research is required on a case-by-case basis. |
