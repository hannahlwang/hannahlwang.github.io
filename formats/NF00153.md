| NARA Preservation Action | Transform | 
| NARA Proposed Preservation Plan | Transform to CSV. If the DBF is part of a Shapefile, transform using Global Mapper. If the DBF is a standalone file, transform using LibreOffice. | 
| Description and Justification | The dBase system includes the core database engine, a query system, a forms engine, and a programming language that ties all of these components together. dBase's underlying file format, the .dbf file, is widely used in other applications needing a simple format to store structured data, including FoxBase, FoxPro, and Visual FoxPro. Further investigation is required on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the information in these files should be integrated into the related database file and how best to do that. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Global Mapper; LibreOffice Calc |
