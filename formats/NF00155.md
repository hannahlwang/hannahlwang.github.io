| NARA Proposed Preservation Plan | Transform to CSV for integration into their related tables if possible, otherwise retain | 
| Description and Justification | DBT database files contains only text "memo" (notes) about database tables, not any other database data, because standard database tables have limitations on character quantity. Typically these files are not meant to be converted. However as text files, their content may be simply copied out. The issue is whether the file can then be properly associated with related data in the database. More likely the DBT file and related files will have to be processed so that the DBT file content is added back into the related database file. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Procure and/or develop tools. It appears these files can be opened in text editors, although it is possible they can only be opened in a database application or a hex editor. It may be possible to open these files in OpenOffice. |
