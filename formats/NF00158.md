| Description and Justification | LEX files are binary files used to extend a default spelling dictionary, and are referenced when a user performs a spell check on a document that he or she is creating. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Microsoft Office can potentially open LEX files |
