| Description and Justification | Digital Picture Exchange (DPX) is a raster image file format; in motion picture, each image file represents a single frame. The DPX container may contain non-DPX audio files in addition to the image files. DPX is considered a preferred format as per NARA Transfer Guidance. The file format is well documented, ubiquitous, and there are open source tools available for transcoding if required in the future. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | FFmpeg; Specialized hardware/software required |
