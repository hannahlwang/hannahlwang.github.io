| Description and Justification | BUP is a file extension for a backup file format used by a number of software packages to create an automatic backup of a data file in case of program errors, or if the file becomes corrupt, lost or unusable. DVD info file (IFO) backup is the most common use for BUP files. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. |
