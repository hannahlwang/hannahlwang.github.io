| Description and Justification | Files that contain the .dvd file extension are commonly associated with DVD burning software. When a user copies and burns a DVD, the file with the .dvd extension is used to burn the selected data to the user's disc. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. |
