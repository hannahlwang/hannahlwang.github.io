| Description and Justification | DVD Info files tell the computer, DVD player, or other device know which screen to show at start-up, where each chapter of the movie starts, where the audio tracks are located and where subtitles can be found. IFO files are associated with the files that store the actual audio (VOb) and video data (VRO). Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. |
