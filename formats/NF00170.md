| Description and Justification | EML is an extension for an email message saved to a file in the Internet Message Format protocol for electronic mail messages. It is the standard format used by Microsoft Outlook Express as well as some other email programs. Since EML files are created to comply with IMF specification RFC 5322, EML files can be used with most email clients, servers and applications. EML files typically store each message as a single file (unlike MBOX which concatenates all the messages from a folder into one file), and attachments may either be included as MIME content in the message or written off as a separate file, referenced from a marker in the EML file. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | PST Viewer Pro; Microsoft Outlook; Mozilla Firefox |
