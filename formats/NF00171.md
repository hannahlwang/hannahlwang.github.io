| Description and Justification | Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a PostScript document with additional restrictions which is intended to be usable as a graphics file format. In other words, EPS files are more-or-less self-contained, reasonably predictable PostScript documents that describe an image or drawing and can be placed within another PostScript document. The Library of Congress Recommended Formats Statement (RFS) includes EPS as an acceptable format for vector and raster graphic images. The RFS does not specify a particular version of EPS. They can be converted to TIFF or JPEG for access purposes. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Adobe Illustrator; Adobe Photoshop; Global Mapper |
