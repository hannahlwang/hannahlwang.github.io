| Description and Justification | It is unclear if the files consist of thumbnails for previewing the picture in file managers, or in photo manipulation software. Exif data are embedded within the image file itself. Many image manipulation programs recognize and preserve Exif data when writing to a modified image. Many image gallery programs also recognize Exif data and optionally display it alongside the images. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | ExifTool; Adobe Photoshop; GNU Image Manipulation Program |
