| Description and Justification | EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code) is a family of character encodings used in a number of IBM mainframe systems in the pre-PC era. It is not strictly speaking a structured data format, but is used as the character encoding for structured data exported from IBM mainframe systems in use in the U.S. government. The format is considered acceptable as per NARA Transfer Guidance. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor; current versions of Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice; Universal Office Converter - command line library that converts between any document format which is supported by LibreOffice/OpenOffice |
