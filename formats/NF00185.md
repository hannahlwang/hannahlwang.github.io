| Description and Justification | eXtensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) is part of the family of XML markup languages. XHTML documents are highly structured and well-formed when compared to HTML. XHTML files are plain text. Web archives should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
