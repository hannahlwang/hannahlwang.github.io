| Description and Justification | Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is a plain text file that can be use to mark up data and content and provide information necessary for processing by external code for display and discovery. XML files are plain text. Web archives should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
