| Description and Justification | XSD (XML Schema Definition) can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform in order to be considered "valid" according to that schema, and express both a document's validity and information about specific encoded data types. XSD files are plain text. Web archives should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
