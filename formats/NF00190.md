| Description and Justification | XSL (also called XSLT) is used to control and look and feel/rendering of HTML or xHTML. It is a plain text format, easily machine and human readable, and a stable and well-documented open format. In addition, XSL and web archives in general should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. Web archives in general should never be migrated, as that would change the fundamental linkages and functionality of web objects. Uncompiled code that is plain text ASCII or Unicode does not require format migration. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | Any supported text editor |
