| Description and Justification | Macromedia/Adobe Flash was a multimedia software platform used for production of animation, rich Internet applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, mobile games and embedded web browser video players. Flash displayed text, vector graphics and raster graphics to provide animations, video games and applications, allowed streaming of audio and video, and could capture mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera input. It is discontinued and no longer supported in modern web browsers. | 
| NARA Preferred Processing and Transformation Tool(s) | FFmpeg; VLC |
