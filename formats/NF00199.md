| Description and Justification | A static library is a set of routines, external functions and variables which are resolved at compile-time and copied into a target application by a compiler, linker, or binder, producing an object file and a stand-alone executable. Static library filenames usually have ".a" extension on Unix-like systems and ".lib" extension on Microsoft Windows. Any format migration for compiled or binary code creates a guaranteed outcome that the code will no longer function, as will extracting files from binary container archives files. |
